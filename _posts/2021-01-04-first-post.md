# The Regional Music Research Group 2021

Welcome to 2021! The Regional Music Research Group is excited to embark on another year of discovery and learning. Our focus remains on exploring the rich tapestry of regional music styles, their origins, and cultural significance. This year, we're expanding our research to include lesser-known musical traditions from around the globe. Expect engaging seminars, collaborative research projects, and, of course, delightful musical evenings. Stay tuned for our upcoming events and join us in celebrating the diversity of world music. Here's to a year of new rhythms and melodies!

Keep in tune,
The Regional Music Research Group Team
